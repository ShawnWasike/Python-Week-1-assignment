# Python-Week-1-assignment
This Python program collects user input for their name, age, and location using the `input()` function and stores the values in corresponding variables. It then prints a personalized message that incorporates the user's input using an `f-string`, demonstrating basic interactive programming. 

The program serves as an introduction to handling user input and string formatting, providing a simple yet effective way to engage users and output dynamic content based on their responses.
